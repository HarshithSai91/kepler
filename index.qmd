# Introduction: {#Introduction}
Kepler.gl is a WebGL-powered, open-source tool for displaying massive amounts of geographical data. It was created by the Visualization team of Uber and allows users to rapidly and simply generate interactive maps without needing to know a lot of code. Kepler.gl automatically processes datasets and creates beautiful visuals using an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface.

Its robust features, which include time-based animations, support for many layers, and 3D mapping, make it perfect for uses in environmental studies, transportation analysis, and urban planning. Kepler.gl offers a smooth method for exploring, analyzing, and sharing location-based insights, regardless of your background as a data scientist, researcher, or analyst.

# Installation & Setup: {#Installation-Setup}
Kepler.gl may be used directly in a web browser or built into a web application, and it is simple to set up. Below are the different ways to install.

## 1. Using Kepler.gl Online (No Installation Required)

The simplest way to use Kepler.gl is through its web application:
Visit Kepler.gl

* Click “Get Started” to launch the tool.

* Upload a dataset (CSV, JSON, or GeoJSON).

* Customize and explore your geospatial data.

## 2. Installing Kepler.gl in a React App


### Step 1: Installation
Use Node v18 and above, older node versions have not been tested
```js
npm install --save kepler.gl @kepler.gl/components @kepler.gl/reducers
```

## Get Mapbox Token
Kepler.gl is built on top of Mapbox GL. A mapbox account and an access token are needed to use kepler.gl in your app. Get a Mapbox Access Token at mapbox.com.

### 0. Working Template

```js
import * as React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import document from "global/document";

import { applyMiddleware, combineReducers, compose, createStore } from "redux";
import { connect, Provider } from "react-redux";

import keplerGlReducer, { enhanceReduxMiddleware } from "@kepler.gl/reducers";
import KeplerGl from "@kepler.gl/components";

import AutoSizer from "react-virtualized/dist/commonjs/AutoSizer";

const reducers = combineReducers({
  keplerGl: keplerGlReducer.initialState({
    uiState: {
      readOnly: false,
      currentModal: null,
    },
  }),
});

const middleWares = enhanceReduxMiddleware([
  // Add other middlewares here
]);

const enhancers = applyMiddleware(...middleWares);

const initialState = {};
const store = createStore(reducers, initialState, compose(enhancers));

const App2 = () => (
  <div
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: "0px",
      left: "0px",
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  >
    <AutoSizer>
      {({ height, width }) => (
        <KeplerGl
          mapboxApiAccessToken="xxx" // Replace with your mapbox token
          id="map"
          width={width}
          height={height}
        />
      )}
    </AutoSizer>
  </div>
);

const mapStateToProps = (state) => state;
const dispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({ dispatch });
const ConnectedApp = connect(mapStateToProps, dispatchToProps)(App2);
const Root = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App2 />
  </Provider>
);

export default Root;
```

### 1. Mount reducer
Kepler.gl uses Redux to manage its internal state, along with react-palm middleware to handle side effects. Mount kepler.gl reducer in your store, apply taskMiddleware.

```js
import keplerGlReducer from '@kepler.gl/reducers';
import {createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware} from 'redux';
import {taskMiddleware} from 'react-palm/tasks';

const reducer = combineReducers({
  // <-- mount kepler.gl reducer in your app
  keplerGl: keplerGlReducer,

  // Your other reducers here
  app: appReducer
});

// create store
const store = createStore(reducer, {}, applyMiddleware(taskMiddleware));
```

### 2. Mount component
```js
import KeplerGl from '@kepler.gl/components';

const Map = props => (
  <KeplerGl
      id="foo"
      mapboxApiAccessToken={token}
      width={width}
      height={height}/>
);
```

### 3. Add data to map
You may dispatch the addDataToMap action from anywhere in your application to interact with a kepler.gl instance and add new data to it.  It refreshes the entire setup (mapState, mapStyle, visState) and adds dataset(s) to a kepler.gl instance.

```js
import {addDataToMap} from '@kepler.gl/actions';

this.props.dispatch(
  addDataToMap({
    // datasets
    datasets: {
      info: {
        label: 'Sample Taxi Trips in New York City',
        id: 'test_trip_data'
      },
      data: sampleTripData
    },
    // option
    option: {
      centerMap: true,
      readOnly: false
    },
    // config
    config: {
      mapStyle: {styleType: 'light'}
    }
  })
);
```

# Key Features & Explanation: {#Key-Features-Explanation}
Kepler.gl is a powerful and user-friendly tool for geospatial data visualization.
Here are its key features:

## 1. Easy Data Import & Automatic Processing

* Supports CSV, JSON, and GeoJSON formats.

* Automatically detects geographic fields like latitude and longitude.

## 2. Multiple Layer Visualizations
Users are able to overlay multiple layers such as:

* Point Layer – Plots single locations.

* Heatmap Layer – Identifies data density.

* Arc Layer – Displays connections between locations.

* Hexbin & Grid Layers – Bins data into hexagonal or square bins.

* Layers can be customized with colors, sizes, and labels.
